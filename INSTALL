------------------------
STEP 1: Configure Source
------------------------

	Each component in this package is independent of the other,
	meaning that you do not need to install all of them for things
	to work.

	In the toplevel directory (same directory as this file) you will
	find; a subdirectory, configure script, and Makefile for each of
	the following programs:

	client			XShipWars official client
	monitor			ShipWars universe monitor
	server			SWServ, official ShipWars universe server
	unvedit			ShipWars universe editor

	For example the XShipWars official client would have:

	client/			The subdirectory
	configure.client	The configure script
	Makefile.client		The Makefile


	To configure the source for your system, type:

	# ./configure.<program> --listall

	Replace <program> with the program's name listed above, this will
	run the compiler test and print all available platforms.
	For additional help, type:

	# ./configure.<program> --help

	To configure the source for a platform, run the configure script 
	with the platform name as the first argument and add any
	additional arguments that you need after it. For example:

	# ./configure.client Linux --prefix=/usr -v --enable="arch-i586"

	Would configure for the platform `Linux' and specify the 
	installation directory prefix to be /usr. The -v means be verbose
	while configuring the source and --enable="arch-i586" enables
	the feature who's name is arch-i586.


	Note about installation directory prefixes:

	For the client, monitor, and unvedit the prefix specifies the
	prefix for the global data files. Default value is /usr/, which
	will be expanded to /usr/share/games/xshipwars/* and /usr/games/*.

	For the server the prefix specifies the prefix for the program's
	native directory. Default value is /home/, which will be expanded
	to /home/swserv/*.


------------------------
STEP 2: Building Program
------------------------

        If there were no problems configuring the source for your
	platform, then just type:

	# make -f Makefile.<program> all

	Where <program> is the name of the program you just configured,
	for example:

	# make -f Makefile.client all

        This will start the compiling process for the XShipWars client.


        If you encountered errors, then you should report them to the
        authors. Read the AUTHORS file for a list of addresses.


--------------------
STEP 3: INSTALLATION
--------------------

	To install, `su' to root as needed and type:

	# make -f Makefile.<program> install

	Where <program> is the name of the program you just configured,
	for example:

	# make -f Makefile.client install

	To install the XShipWars client.


	Notes on installing the XShipWars client:

	After you run `make -f Makefile.client install' to install the
	client, you need to make sure that you also have the following
	packages (distributed separatly at the same place where you got
	this package):

	* Client data files (older versions will work).
	* Atleast one graphics theme.


	Notes on installing the SWServ server:

	SWServ comes fully installed with all the files needed to get
	started on creating your own universe. It comes with the default
	`generic universe', however you should be familiar with playing on
	a ShipWars universe first before you try to create one.

	For information on setting up SWServ:

--------------------
STEP 4: FIRST FLIGHT
--------------------

	If you are new to ShipWars, then follow the instructions in this
	section carefully.

	After installing the XShipWars client and all its related 
	packages, you should get a copy of the installed global
	XShipWars client configuration file and copy it to your home
	directory:

	# cd /usr/share/games/xshipwars/etc/
	# cp xshipwarsrc ~/.shipwars/xshipwarsrc
        # cp universes ~/.shipwars/universes

	You may manually edit ~/.shipwars/xshipwarsrc (the XShipWars
	client configuration file), but do not modify any values that
	you are unsure of. Most options for the XShipWars client can be
	configured at run time.


	Now run the XShipWars client, type:

	# xsw &

	Or to specify an alternate configuration file from the command
	line, type:

	# xsw -f ~/.shipwars/xshipwarsrc.someoneelse &


	If the universes list does not show up when the XShipWars client
	window appears, then just right-click on the main `view screen'
	and go to Connect...

	Select a universe to connect to (skip the local ones if you do
	not have a local universe set up). Most of the preset universes
	allow Guest log in.

	If you need to configure some options or set up your keyboard
	mapping, go to right-click->Options...->General->Keyboard Mapping.

	Once connected you can enter a server command (default key is
	'e' for server command) and type on the server command prompt:

	# who

	This will list all players on-line. To talk globally, press
	'e' then, type:

	# wall Hello world!


	Don't hesitate to ask if you need additional help! You can contact
	the authors via e-mail, please read the file AUTHORS for a list of
	addresses.
