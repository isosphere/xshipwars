                             Widget Set


	The header file is ../include/widget.h

	This widget set was created to ensure portability for XSW.
	You may use this widget set in your programs however
	it's compiled static only.  Also no external libary is
	available for this widget set either.

	There may be plans in the future if this widget set becomes
	more popular and there is demand.


	The demo program can be compiled by running 'make' in this
	directory. The links to the other global sources are only
	for compiling the demo program and are not used by the widget
	set.

	The script makelinks is to link all the widget source
	files in your current dir to this one.  Review makelinks
	before you run it!
