#   ShipWars: Server Configuration
#
#	Master configuration information for SWServ, the ShipWars Universe
#	Server.
#
#	Each `universe' should have its own configuration file, so
#	to start SWServ and instruct it to load all the nessasary
#	resources just run:
#
#	    swserv myuniverse.conf
#
#	Where myuniverse.conf is the configuration file (like this one
#	you are reading now) that contains all the correct settings for
#	loading files and setting values for a specific universe.
#
#	You may run multiple processes of swserv, but only one process
#	per unique universe.
#

#   Port number:
#
#	Standard port(s) for players connecting to this universe. Make
#	sure this port number does not conflict with other servers
#	(including other processes of swserv) that are using the port
#	number(s).
#
#	You may specify more than one port number, each one you specify
#	will create a new listening port for standard incoming connections.
#
#ListeningPort = 8472
ListeningPort = 1701


#   AUX Stats Port number:
#
#       AUX stats monitoring port number for monitoring clients that want
#	to get stats about this universe.
#
#	If you do not want any AUX monitoring ports, then do not
#	specify any ports here. Only players with proper security
#	levels may get additional AUX stats information (such as log
#	messages). Guests may only get whatever you allow Guests to
#	have (more Guest configuration parameters farther below).
#
#	You may specify more than one port.
#
#AUXStatsListeningPort = 8473
AUXStatsListeningPort = 1702

#                        System Parameters

#
#	Interval for sending standard object values (not positions)
#	to all connections.
#
#	Units are in milliseconds.
#
IntervalObjectValues = 4000

#   Weapon Values Update Interval:
#
#	Interval for sending values of weapons (on vessels, not

#
#	Units are in milliseconds.
#
IntervalWeaponValues = 10000


#   AUX Stats Update Interval
#
#	Interval for sending AUX stats to monitoring connections
#	on port number specified in AUXStatsListeningPort.
#
#	AUX stats are sent to monitoring clients, the stats include
#	how many players and guests connected, the number of objects
#	in the universe, and various other messages depending on
#	the security level of each monitoring connection.
#
#	Units are in milliseconds.
#
IntervalAUXStats = 5000


#   OS Stats Fetching Interval:
#
#	Interval for fetching stats from the OS (such as disk space
#	left and free memory).
#
#	Units are in seconds.
#
IntervalOSStats = 600

#   Database Automatic Save Interval:
#
#	Interval for automatic saving of the universe database
#	to the file specified in DBOut.
#
#	Units are in seconds.
#
IntervalUnvSave = 3600

#   Stats Export To File Interval:
#
#	Interval for exporting universe statisitics to file, such
#	as scores and connections.

#	Do not confuse this with IntervalAUXStats which
#	specifies the interval for sending stats to monitoring
#	connections.
#

#   Welcome message:
#
#	This message is sent right after a successful login.  The
#	following tokens can be used in the message:
#
#	Token		Replace by
#
#	%name		Connection's object name.
#	%title		Universe's name.
#
MessageWelcome = Welcome to %title, %name.


#   Leave message:
#
#	This message is sent when the connection disconnects. The
#	following tokens can be used in the message:
#
#	Token           Replace by
#
#	%name		Connection's object name (if available)
#	%title		Universe's name.
#
#	Note: if connection did not log in, %name will be
#	"*unknown*".
#
MessageLeave = Disconnected from %title.


#   Maximum connections:

#       Maximum number of connections that are logged in
#	(includes guest and registered user connections).
#

#   Allow guest logins?:
#
AllowGuestLogins = yes


#   No guests allowed message:
#
#	This message is sent when a connection attempts to login
#	as a guest but AllowGuestLogins is set to no. The following
#	tokens can be used in the message:
#
#	Token           Replace by
#
#	%name           Connection's object name.
#	%title          Universe's name.
#
MessageNoGuests = %name connections are not permitted in %title.


#   Guest login name:
#
#	Login name for guest connections.
#
GuestLoginName = Guest


#   Maximum guest connections:
#
#	You probably will want to increase this value if your
#	running a server with a high bandwidth and expect lots
#	of guest logins. A low default value is set to keep
#	servers running through modem connections safe from too
#	many guest connections.
#
MaxGuests = 5


#   Maximum AUX stats connections:
#
#	Set this to 0 if you do not want to allow AUX Stats.
#
#	Do NOT comment out this line, commenting out this line will
#	set it to its default value!
#
MaxAUXStatsConnections = 3


#   Connect notify:
#
#	Notify all connections of a connect or disconnect
#	(if successfully logged in) and who it was.
#
ConnectNotify = yes


#   Login timeout:
#
#	Login expires after this many seconds from the moment the
#	new connection is accept()ed.
#
LoginTimeout = 45


#   Maximum failed logins:
#
#	Connection is disconnected after this many failed
#	login attempts. Normally you want to set this to 1 since
#	clients often retry logins with the same name/password
#	and manual logins are almost unheard of.
#
MaxFailedLogins = 1

#   Incorrent login response message:
#
MessageWrongLogin = Either that player does not exist, or has a different password.


#   Force one connection per object:
#
#	This prevents multiple connections per object, which is
#	a violation of most universe rules. You almost always will
#	want to set this to yes.
#
SingleConnection = yes


#   Send Star Chart:
#
#	If set to yes, then sends complete Star Chart to client on
#	initial connect and on refreshes.
#
SendStarChart = yes


#   Cease fire:
#
#	Prevents everyone from firing/using weapons.
#
CeaseFire = no

#   Hide players when they disconnect at a HOME object:
#
#	Normally you would want this set to yes to hide player objects
#	not connected at HOME objects which harbour many player objects,
#	thus reducing cpu and network load.
#
HidePlayers = yes

#   Homes destroyable:
#
#	Allows objects of type HOME to be destroyable. You probably
#	do not want this in a general sense since HOME objects do
#	take quite some time to rebuilt if they are destroyed.
#
#	You probably would only want to set this to yes if you are
#	setting up a universe for a repeated mission or campaign in
#	which the goal is to destroy a HOME object.
#
HomesDestroyable = no

#   Killer gets credits of destroyed object:
#
#	Set this to yes if you want to owner of the weapon object
#	that destroyed another object to get all the credits of
#	that object. This is good for help keeping a closed economy
#	where when an object is destroyed, the credits that it has
#	is never lost.
#
KillerGetsCredits = yes

#   Report weapon objects that get destroyed:
#
#	Set this to yes if you want to notify when a weapon object
#	gets destroyed (by another weapon object). Useful for
#	universes that involve intercepting long range cruise
#	weapons but annoying in close range battles.
#
ReportDestroyedWeapons = no

#   Hit player object bonus coefficient:
#
#	When you give damage to a player object, the unit damage given
#	is multiplied by this value and then given to yourself as
#	credits. For example: if this value is set to 0.25, then
#	inflicting 100 units of damage on a player object will give
#	yourself 25 credits.
#
#	If you have a closed economy system, then you definatly will
#	want to set this value to 0.
#
HitPlayerBonus = 0.25
