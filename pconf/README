ABOUT
-----

   This is a very experimental Makefile generator, designed to generate
a Makefile suitable for compiling a program based on information from
a list of platforms and specifica values for each one.

For those of you familiar with AutoConf, this basically works just like it
with more or less features but nearly identical user-end syntax.


   Platform Configurator was created by WolfPack Entertainment due to
frustration from AutoConf and certain issues that just didn't tayor AutoConf
for our needs.

We understand and respect those who successfully use AutoConf, however we
were not fortunate to get it working in the past two years and rather than
expend more time on it we decided to `reinvent the wheel'. In which case to
our delights the new design has worked out better than we anticipated.

Note that Platform Configurator is fully documented, if you are a 
developer and interested in further understanding then please read the 
file FORMAT which describes the configuration file format that pconf uses.


   Platform Configurator is not distributed in any means other than with
WPE's software, however it is under GPL license. We grant you the right to 
use pconf if you find it useful but you will have to rip it out of the 
package it came from.

We are happy to answer support questions that you may have, contact WPE if 
you need assistance http://wolfpack.twu.net/contacts.html
